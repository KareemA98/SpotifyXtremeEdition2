# SpotifyXtremeEdition2
This a repo for my Android Development Coursework, the goal was to create an App which allows you to make a playlist from songs in another playlist by introducing filters not available in the regular Spotify App. 

* A loadable application for Android with an APK in the Repo.
* Allows a myriad of customization options
* Uses the Spotify API and OAuth 2.0 to retrieve the user's info securely.
* Creates and auto opens the Spotify app when a playlist is created.

## Process
1. The app was created in android studio, and the outline of how it should work was created.
2. The code to connect to the Spotify API with OAuth 2.0 was produced.
3. With access to the users Spotify playlist, we retrieved data on all the songs in the playlist.
4. Using JAVA object-orientated technique, it was possible to create song objects and add all related data on a song to the object.
5. The song objects allowed for easy sorting to be done on loads of different variables.
6. After the final variables have been decided. The new playlist is created on the user's account.

## Tools used
* JAVA
* Android Studio
* Spotify API
* OAuth 2.0
